# spaceshooter

This project will be a series of python projects to reinforce learning and become familiar again with more OOP
I've been writing python scripts on a daily basis now for around 3 years but only a few times have I worked on 
applications. This project will be the first in improving my knowledge and becoming familiar again with more advance
programming practices. 

## Pygame

I will be going through the pygame documentation and creating a simple space shooter where player will destroy
other spaceships in order to score points.
